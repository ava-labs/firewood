# A firewood golang interface

This allows calling into firewood from golang

## Building

First, build the release version (`cargo build --release`). This creates the ffi
interface file "firewood.h" as a side effect.

Then, you can run the tests in go, using `go test .`

## Development
Iterative building is unintuitive for the ffi and some common sources of confusion are listed below.

### CGO Regeneration

As you edit any Rust code and save the file in VS Code, the `firewood.h` file is automatically updated with edited function and struct definitions. However, the Go linter will not recognize these changes until you manually regenerate the cgo wrappers. To do this, you can run `go tool cgo firewood.go`. Alternatively, in VS Code, right above the `import "C"` definition, you can click on the small letters saying "regenerate CGO definitions". This will allow the linter to use the altered definitions. 

Because the C header file is autogenerated from the Rust code, the naming matches exactly (due to the `no_mangle` macro). However, the C definitions imported in Go do not match exactly, and are prefixed with `struct_`. Function naming is the same as the header file. These names are generated by the `go tool cgo` command above.

### Testing
Although the VS Code testing feature does work, there are some quirks in ensuring proper building. The Rust code must be compiled separated, and sometimes the `go test` command continues to use a cached result. Whenever testing after making changes to the Rust/C builds, the cache should be cleared if results don't seem correct. Do not compile with `--features ethhash`, as some tests will fail.

To ensure there are no memory leaks, the easiest way is to use your preferred CLI tool (e.g. `valgrind` for Linux, `leaks` for macOS) and compile the tests into a binary. You must not compile a release binary to ensure all memory can be managed. An example flow is given below.
```
cd ffi
cargo build # use debug
go test -a -c -o binary_file # ignore cache
leaks --nostacks --atExit -- ./binary_file
```
