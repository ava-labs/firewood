# Firewood Golang FFI

The FFI package provides a golang FFI layer for Firewood.

## Building Firewood Golang FFI

The Golang FFI layer uses a CGO directive to locate a C-API compatible binary built from Firewood. Firewood supports both seamless local development and a single-step compilation process for Go projects that depend or transitively depend on Firewood.

To do this, [firewood.go](./firewood.go) includes CGO directives to include multiple search paths for the Firewood binary in the local `target/` build directory and `ffi/libs`. For the latter, [attach-static-libs](../.github/workflows/attach-static-libs.yaml) GitHub Action pushes an FFI package with static libraries attached for the following supported architectures:

- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- aarch64-apple-darwin
- x86_64-apple-darwin

to a separate repo [firewood-go](https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood-go) (to avoid including binaries in the Firewood repo).

### Local Development

[firewood.go](./firewood.go) includes CGO directives to include builds in the `target/` directory.

Firewood prioritizes builds in the following order:

1. maxperf
2. release
3. debug

To use and test the Firewood FFI locally, you can run:

```bash
cargo build --profile maxperf
cd ffi
go test
```

To use a local build of Firewood for a project that depends on Firewood, you must redirect the `go.mod` to use the local version of Firewood FFI, for example:

```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/ava-labs/firewood-go/ffi=/path/to/firewood/ffi
go mod tidy
```

### Production Development Flow

Firewood pushes the FFI source code and attached static libraries to [firewood-go](https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood-go) via [attach-static-libs](../.github/workflows/attach-static-libs.yaml).

This enables consumers to utilize it directly without forcing them to compile Firewood locally. Go programs running on supported architectures can utilize `firewood-go/ffi` just like any other dependency.

To trigger this build, [attach-static-libs](../.github/workflows/attach-static-libs.yaml) supports triggers for both manual GitHub Actions and tags, so you can create a mirror branch/tag on [firewood-go](https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood-go) by either trigger a manual GitHub Action and selecting your branch or pushing a tag to Firewood.

### Hash Mode

Firewood implemented its own optimized merkle trie structure. To support Ethereum Merkle Trie hash compatibility, it also provides a feature flag `ethhash`.

This is an optional feature (disabled by default). To enable it for a local build, compile with:

```sh
cargo build -p firewood-ffi --features ethhash
```

To support development in [Coreth](https://github.com/ava-labs/coreth), Firewood pushes static libraries to [firewood-go](https://github.com/ava-labs/firewood-go) with `ethhash` enabled by default.

## Development

Iterative building is unintuitive for the ffi and some common sources of confusion are listed below.

### CGO Regeneration

As you edit any Rust code and save the file in VS Code, the `firewood.h` file is automatically updated with edited function and struct definitions. However, the Go linter will not recognize these changes until you manually regenerate the cgo wrappers. To do this, you can run `go tool cgo firewood.go`. Alternatively, in VS Code, right above the `import "C"` definition, you can click on the small letters saying "regenerate CGO definitions". This will allow the linter to use the altered definitions.

Because the C header file is autogenerated from the Rust code, the naming matches exactly (due to the `no_mangle` macro). However, the C definitions imported in Go do not match exactly, and are prefixed with `struct_`. Function naming is the same as the header file. These names are generated by the `go tool cgo` command above.

### Testing

Although the VS Code testing feature does work, there are some quirks in ensuring proper building. The Rust code must be compiled separated, and sometimes the `go test` command continues to use a cached result. Whenever testing after making changes to the Rust/C builds, the cache should be cleared if results don't seem correct. Do not compile with `--features ethhash`, as some tests will fail.

To ensure there are no memory leaks, the easiest way is to use your preferred CLI tool (e.g. `valgrind` for Linux, `leaks` for macOS) and compile the tests into a binary. You must not compile a release binary to ensure all memory can be managed. An example flow is given below.

```sh
cd ffi
cargo build # use debug
go test -a -c -o binary_file # ignore cache
leaks --nostacks --atExit -- ./binary_file
```
