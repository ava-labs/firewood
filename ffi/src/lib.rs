// HINT WHEN REFERENCING TYPES OUTSIDE THIS LIBRARY:
// - Anything that is outside the crate must be included as a `type` alias (not just
//   a `use`) in order for cbindgen to generate an opaque forward declaration. The type
//   alias can have a doc comment which will be included in the generated header file.
// - The value must be boxed, or otherwise used via a pointer. This is because only
//   a forward declaration is generated and callers will be unable to instantiate the
//   type without a complete definition.
