//! Cryptographic proof system for Merkle tries.
//!
//! This module provides a complete proof system for verifying the presence or absence
//! of key-value pairs in Firewood's Merkle trie implementation without requiring access
//! to the entire trie structure. The proof system enables efficient verification of trie
//! state using cryptographic hashes.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Firewood's proof system consists of several key components:
//!
//! - **Single-key proofs** ([`Proof`]): Verify that a specific key-value pair exists
//!   (or doesn't exist) in a trie with a given root hash.
//! - **Range proofs** ([`RangeProof`]): Verify that a contiguous set of key-value pairs
//!   exists within a specific key range.
//! - **Serialization format**: A compact binary format for transmitting proofs over the
//!   network or storing them persistently.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The proof system is organized into several submodules:
//!
//! - `types`: Core proof types including [`Proof`], [`ProofNode`], [`ProofError`], and
//!   [`ProofCollection`].
//! - `range`: Range proof implementation for verifying multiple consecutive keys.
//! - `header`: Proof format headers and validation.
//! - `reader`: Proof reading and deserialization utilities.
//! - `ser`: Proof serialization implementation (internal).
//! - `de`: Proof deserialization implementation (internal).
//! - `childmap`: Compact bitmap for tracking present children (internal).
//! - `magic`: Magic constants for proof format identification (internal).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! For most use cases, import proof types directly from the top level of the crate:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use firewood::{Proof, ProofNode, RangeProof};
//!
//! // Verify a single key
//! let proof: Proof<Vec<ProofNode>> = /* ... */;
//! proof.verify(b"key", Some(b"value"), &root_hash)?;
//!
//! // Verify a key range
//! let range_proof: RangeProof<Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>, Vec<ProofNode>> = /* ... */;
//! for (key, value) in &range_proof {
//!     // Process key-value pairs
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Proof Format
//!
//! Proofs are serialized in a compact binary format that includes:
//!
//! 1. A 32-byte header identifying the proof type, version, hash mode, and branching factor
//! 2. A sequence of proof nodes, each containing:
//!    - The node's key path (variable length)
//!    - The node's value or value hash (if present)
//!    - A bitmap indicating which children are present
//!    - The hash of each present child
//!
//! The serialization format is versioned to allow for future evolution while maintaining
//! backward compatibility with proof verification.
