//! A LinearStore provides a view of a set of bytes at
//! a given time. A LinearStore has three different types,
//! which refer to another base type, as follows:
//! ```mermaid
//! stateDiagram-v2
//!     R1(Committed) --> R2(Committed)
//!     R2(Committed) --> R3(FileBacked)
//!     P1(Proposed) --> R3(FileBacked)
//!     P2(Proposed) --> P1(Proposed)
//! ```
//!
//! Each type is described in more detail below.

use std::io::{Error, Read};

mod committed;
/// A linear store used for proposals
///
/// A Proposed LinearStore supports read operations which look for the
/// changed bytes in the `new` member, and if not present, delegate to
/// their parent.
///
/// The old map is maintained because it is needed if this proposal commits.
/// The old and new maps contain the same entries unless the address extends
/// beyond the end of the base linear store, in which case only new bytes
/// exist
///
/// The parent can either be another `Proposed` store or a `FileBacked` store.
///
/// The second generic parameter specifies whether this proposal is mutable or
/// not. Mutable proposals implement the `ReadWriteLinearStore` trait
///
/// The possible combinations are:
///  - `Proposed<Proposed, ReadWrite>` (in-progress nested proposal)
///  - `Proposed<Proposed, ReadOnly>` (completed nested proposal)
///  - `Proposed<FileBacked, ReadWrite>` (first proposal on base revision)
///  - `Proposed<FileBacked, ReadOnly>` (completed first proposal on base)
///
/// Transitioning from ReadWrite to ReadOnly just prevents future mutations to
/// the proposal maps. ReadWrite proposals only exist during the application of
/// a Batch to the proposal, and are subsequently changed to ReadOnly
///
/// # How a commit works
///
/// Lets assume we have the following:
///  - bytes "on disk":   (0, 1, 2) `LinearStore<FileBacked>`
///  - bytes in proposal: (   3   ) `LinearStore<Proposed<FileBacked, ReadOnly>>`
/// that is, we're changing the second byte (1) to (3)
///
/// To commit:
///  - Convert the `LinearStore<FileBacked>` to `LinearStore<Committed>` taking the
/// old pages from the `LinearStore<Proposed<FileBacked, Readonly>>`
///  - Change any direct child proposals from `LinearStore<Proposed<Proposed, Readonly>>`
/// into `LinearStore<FileBacked>`
///  - Invalidate any other `LinearStore` that is a child of `LinearStore<FileBacked>`
///  - Flush all the `Proposed<FileBacked, ReadOnly>::new` bytes to disk
///  - Convert the `LinearStore<Proposed<FileBacked, Readonly>>` to `LinearStore<FileBacked>`
